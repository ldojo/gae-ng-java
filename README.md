# gae-ng-java
boilerplate seed Eclipse project for Google App Engine (GAE), Java, and AngularJS development

This project contains code for Eclipse (tested on Luna) to be imported as a GAE project.
The code contains the seed code for AngularJS development alongside GAE, using Java. 
The AngularJS code comes from https://github.com/ldojo/angular-seed

To setup,

$ cd Gae-ng-java/war/angular-seed/
$ npm install

Run the project in Eclipse as you would a regular GAE project.

Navigate to http://localhost:8888/angular-seed/app/index.html

The two views you'll see are managed by AngularJS
